# bfs-visualizer-v2
Hey!

I had pushed a repo before this named "bfs visualizing v1". The v1 of the visualizer didn't make sense at all, since the user could only see random blue squares turning yellow. We couldn't really "visualize" anything really.

Hence, I made a v2, where you could actually see the nodes and the links between the nodes, and therefore, can figure out how the alogrithm is working by actually seeing visualization in action this time. 

To run it, just run "graphics.py" and keep "bfs.py" in the same folder. The project depends on pygame, and numpy. 


cheers
